        <p><b>To understand why Wattle Partners are the best people to assist you in achieving your goals, it is important to understand the background of our industry. </b></p>

        <p>The financial planning industry does not have a great reputation for acting in the best interest of clients. 
            In our view, this has been a result of the vertical integration of advice providers like the Commonwealth Bank, 
            who both create products and employ the staff that ‘advise’ on them. Unfortunately, these issues affect around 90% of the industry.</p>

        <p>Through our decades of our collective experience we have concluded that the industry simply has not evolved. Financial planners continue to be focused on 
            minimising the amount of work required to assist their clients and recommending strategies that are of lowest risk to their businesses, rather than in the
             best interests of their clients. In our view, most advisers seek to make things more complicated for their clients to increase their importance; rather than 
             simplifying them. We believe in the following:</p>

                <p><b>As the ranks of ‘independent’ advisers continue to grow, Wattle Partners stands out by virtue of its heritage and experience 
                    in providing independent financial advice that is tailored to each individual client.</b></p>
                <p>Our heritage comes from being one of the first and consistently independent, fee-for-service advisory firms. 
                    Wattle Partners was originally founded by Austin Donnelly, as Donnelly Money Management in the 1990’s, 
                    and the advisory team spent many years learning his philosophies. Austin Donnelly was once considered the Number 1 
                    Financial Adviser in Australia and was well known for his push for transparency in fees and investments, dedication to 
                    improving investor rights and the importance of tailoring solutions to every person. Austin also founded the Australian Investor’s Association, 
                    which is a not-for-profit community of like-minded self-directed investors, with which Wattle Partners remains a strong support of today. </p>

                <p><b>On the 1st of September 2017, we changed our name from Sornem Private Wealth to Wattle Partners.</b>
                    The decision to change was not a simple one, but in our view was required to represent the evolution of our team. 
                    To us, the wattle tree reflects our roots in Victoria, where wattle trees grow naturally and in abundance. 
                    They are also diverse, with some 1,000-recorded species, reflecting the broad range of people that come together to form our community. 
                    Most importantly, the wattle reflects our commitment to nurturing and growing our relationship with 
                    you and your family as we support you in achieving your objectives.</p>
