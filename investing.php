    <div class="about-information">
        
        <p><b>Whilst the manner in which we uncover, identify and analyse investment ideas is highly complex, our overriding philosophy is straightforward.</b></p>

        <p>History has shown that investing into shares provides the greatest rewards over the long-term. 
            We understand that a successful financial plan requires investment in capital markets over the long-term. 
            We know that short-term, highly active trading adds little value and that outstanding returns come from the benefits of compounding; 
            or maintaining your exposure to markets over the long-term. We believe that simply investing into those companies paying the highest dividends 
            will result in underperformance, so we search all over of the world and in all sectors, both traditional and alternative, for investment opportunities. 
            At our core, we are fundamental, value-oriented investors. We seek to identify investments trading at a discount to their fair value and which offer the potential 
            to grow earnings in a changing economic environment. We have a preference to invest directly into share and other asset markets, but believe managed funds can add 
            substantial value where their strategy is focused to an individual sector. We appreciate the value and cost savings that highly popular index and exchange traded funds can provide, 
            but we do not believe today’s environment is a suitable time for these strategies.</p>

        <h2>Dynamic Asset Allocation</h2>
        <img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/img/wattle-icon.png" alt="Wattle Partners icon">

    <div class="about-heritage">
        
        <p><b>We do not subscribe to the passive, static asset allocation approach of our competitors.</b>We believe it is common-sense that your portfolio should be adjusted 
        for both your changing attitude to risk, as your life changes, as well as the prevailing valuations of assets across the globe. Unfortunately, the ‘traditional’ 
        approach seems to ignore this logic to simplify the process for the advisory industry. There is no wonder this approach has seen investors greatly 
        underperform expectations and taking substantially more risk than required over the last 10, 20 and 30 years. </p>

        <p>We aim to be dynamic rather than static in everything we do, but particularly in managing your portfolio. We implement this by:</p>

         <ul>
            <li><p>Determining an appropriate allocation to Defensive assets for you specifically; </p></li>
            <li><p>Regularly adjusting our views on the appropriate level of Growth asset exposure; </p></li>
            <li><p>Increasing or decreasing your Defensive allocation as conditions change;</p></li>
            <li><p>Increasing or decreasing your allocation between our various Bucket’s as conditions change.</p></li>
        </ul>
    
    </div>

             <div class="about-heritage">

                <p>We refuse to pigeon hole our clients into ‘portfolios’ or individual investments based on the ‘conventional’ wisdom of the industry. 
                    We seek to understand the actual characteristics of the investments we are considering and allocating them appropriately. 
                    For this reason, we believe investments should have one of four purposes:</p>

                <ol>

                    <li><p><b>To provide an income - The income Bucket;</b></p></li>
                    <li><p><b>To offer substantial future value – The Value Bucket;</b></p></li>
                    <li><p><b>To generate capital growth over the long-term – The Thematic Growth Bucket;</b></p></li>
                    <li><p><b>To provide a hedge against poor markets or unexpected events – The Targeted Return Bucket.</b></p></li>
                </ol>

                <p>Above all, at Wattle Partners, we seek to question the conventional wisdom, or the ‘herd’ and to be unconventional. 
                    We know that following the herd leads to below average returns and we believe investors should be seeking absolute 
                    returns that allow them to meet their goals, rather than returns relative to an index. </p>
